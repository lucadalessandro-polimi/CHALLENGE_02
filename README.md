# CHALLENGE_02: SPARSE MATRIX IMPLEMENTATION
the folder contains the following files:

1. Insp_131.mtx: file that collects the values and dimension of the matrix to test
2. Sparse_matrix.hpp: the file has the template class SparseMatrix, with the declarations of the methods, the private members, and two definitions of the * operator and ostream operator.
3. Sparse_matrix_impl_hpp: here we have all the definitions of the methods of the template class SparseMatrix
4. chrono.hpp: file to test the speed of some part of the code, in this case the * operator in the four cases requested.
